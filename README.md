# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis of the Vine program
<br>
The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by the members of the paid Amazon Vine Program. This program is a service that provides Amazon Vine members products to review in return for the product itself. We would like to determine whether there are any bias towards favorable  revies from Vine members in our data.

## Results

We first filtered the data set to only reviews with 20 or more votes and with 50% or more helpful votes per total votes. See the screen shot(s) below.
